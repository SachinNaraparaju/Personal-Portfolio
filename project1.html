        <h1 class="project-title">Project Purpose and Goal</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          The purpose of the Prodigy AI project was to create an innovative
          Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that harnessed the power of
          artificial intelligence to meet the growing demand for AI-driven
          creative tools. As the sole creator of this project, the primary goal
          was to explore and incorporate various AI APIs and cutting-edge web
          development technologies to build a professional-looking and
          feature-rich full-stack website offering a range of creative
          functions.
          <br /><br />By combining the latest advancements in AI with web
          development expertise, the project aimed to deliver a seamless and
          user-friendly experience to customers seeking AI-powered solutions for
          their creative endeavors. The project strived to provide users with a
          one-stop platform where they could access a diverse set of tools, such
          as the chat bot, AI image creation, AI video creation, AI audio
          creation, and AI code generation. <br /><br />Ultimately, the purpose
          and goal of the Prodigy AI project were to not only demonstrate
          technical proficiency in web development and AI integration but also
          to deliver a valuable and transformative service to users, empowering
          them to unlock their creative potential and stay ahead in a rapidly
          evolving digital landscape.
        </p>
        <h1 class="project-title">Web Stack Explanation</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          The Prodigy AI platform was built using a modern and robust web stack,
          incorporating a range of cutting-edge frameworks and APIs to deliver a
          seamless and secure user experience.
          <br /><br />For the front end, the project leveraged a combination of
          Shadcn, React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Shadcn provided a sleek and
          polished visual foundation, while React and Next.js ensured smooth
          rendering and efficient client-side navigation. Tailwind CSS offered a
          utility-first approach to styling, allowing for the creation of a
          professional-looking website with functional components and a
          responsive design. <br /><br />To prioritize security and user
          identification, the platform integrated Clerk, which enabled a secure
          user authentication process. This ensured that user data and
          interactions remained protected, establishing trust with the
          platform's users. <br /><br />For seamless customer support, Prodigy
          AI implemented Crisp, a user-friendly and clean customer support
          system. This allowed users to seek assistance and resolve queries
          easily, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.
          <br /><br />To manage payment plans for both free and premium tiers,
          Stripe was incorporated as the payment gateway. This enabled secure
          and efficient processing of payments, providing users with a
          hassle-free subscription experience. <br /><br />On the backend, the
          project utilized an array of open-source AI APIs, primarily from
          OpenAI and Replicate. These APIs empowered the platform to offer
          AI-driven features like chat bot interactions, AI image creation, AI
          video creation, AI audio creation, and AI code generation. The
          seamless integration of these APIs expanded the platform's
          capabilities and delivered powerful creative tools to users.
          <br /><br />To ensure efficient data management and storage of user
          payment details, Prodigy AI employed Prisma and PlanetScale's SQL
          database. Prisma facilitated easy and flexible data manipulation,
          while PlanetScale's SQL database ensured robust and scalable storage
          solutions.
        </p>
        <h1 class="project-title">Problems and Thought Process</h1>
        <p class="body-text">
          During the Prodigy AI project, several challenges arose that required
          careful problem-solving and a systematic approach to overcome them.
          <br /><br />The initial challenge came during the selection of
          frameworks for the front end. While Shadcn, Next.js, React, and
          TypeScript were chosen for their modern capabilities and ease of
          creating visually appealing websites, integrating them smoothly and
          ensuring responsive design posed difficulties. However, through a
          combination of studying Shadcn's documentation and seeking guidance
          from tutorials, each component was painstakingly pieced together to
          achieve the desired outcome. <br /><br />Another hurdle emerged during
          the implementation of user authentication and payment workflows.
          Connecting these essential functionalities proved complex, but the
          project benefited from the well-documented APIs of Clerk and Stripe.
          With perseverance and careful integration, unique user IDs were
          successfully stored and mapped to corresponding Stripe customer IDs,
          ensuring a secure and efficient payment process. The use of various
          APIs, while expanding the platform's capabilities, introduced the
          challenge of seamlessly integrating multiple API calls. The thought
          process involved careful planning, considering the sequence of API
          requests, handling responses, and maintaining a smooth user experience
          throughout. Deploying the website brought its own set of challenges,
          particularly in setting up webhooks with the Stripe API. Extensive
          debugging and multiple test cases were required to ensure that payment
          processing and notifications functioned flawlessly, providing users
          with a reliable and hassle-free experience. <br /><br />Throughout the
          project, problem-solving involved a combination of reading
          documentation, exploring tutorials, seeking support from the developer
          community, and conducting thorough testing. With a persistent and
          systematic approach, each problem was addressed and resolved,
          ultimately leading to the successful creation of Prodigy AI - a
          powerful and user-friendly SaaS platform that empowers users to
          unleash their creative potential with AI-driven tools.
